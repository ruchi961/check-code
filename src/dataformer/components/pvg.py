The `Timetable` class manages the list of exams and rooms, and the `schedule_exams` method schedules each exam in an available room.

We\'ve added a `current_time` attribute to the `Room` class to keep track of the current time in each room.\n2.  In the `find_earliest_room` method, we iterate through the rooms and check if the current time in each room is less than or equal to the start time of the exam. We return the room with the earliest available time slot.\n3.  In the `schedule_exam_in_room` method, we schedule the exam in the room by appending it to the `exams` list and updating the `current_time` attribute of the room.\n4.  We\'ve modified the `conflicts` method to check if the exam conflicts with the new exam by iterating through the exams in each room and checking if the start time of the new exam is within the duration of the existing exam.\n5.  We\'ve added an `optimize_timetable` method to optimize the timetable by sorting the rooms based on the number of exams they have and then sorting the exams in each room based on their start time.\n6.  In the example usage, we create a list of exams with varying durations and start times and schedule them using the `Timetable` class.\n\nThis revised solution addresses the refined query and additional requirements by efficiently scheduling exams in each room, handling conflicts, and optimizing the timetable to minimize the number of rooms used and the total duration of the exams.
